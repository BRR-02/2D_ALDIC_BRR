%%%%%%% ReadMe file of "Sample14Exact.mat" %%%%%%%%

The original Sample 14 datasets can be downloaded at: https://sem.org/2ddic
There was also an exact deformation field Excel file there. But somehow this file seems to disappear. Here I provide the exact deformation field of Sample 14 based on a previously downloaded Excel file.



You can load "Sample14Exact.mat" file to MATLAB.

size of the loaded variable "Sample14Exact" is 2048 x 7 

First column:  x-pixel location;

Second, 4th, 6th columns: x-displacement fields of L1, L3, and L5 data sets;

Third, 5th, 7th columns: 1e6* exx strain values of L1, L3, and L5 data sets.
So the true strain values in L1-L5 are that 3rd, 5th, 7th columns divide 1e6.



Hope you enjoy this data! :)
